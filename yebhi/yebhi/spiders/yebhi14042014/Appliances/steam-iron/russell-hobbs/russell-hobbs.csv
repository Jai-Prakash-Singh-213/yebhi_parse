It has an anti-drip feature so you won?t soak your clothing  floor or flex and  because it?s transparent  you can see how much water you?re putting into it so you know when to stop. It has an anti-calcium function and is self-cleaning so you don?t have to worry about ?build-up? compromising its power. :  For additional security  the iron has a non-slip heel so there?s no danger of it sliding out of the ironing board cradle. An extra long 3m power cord allows you to put your ironing board up anywhere you like so you can watch TV while you iron ? or you could even take the ironing outdoors on glorious summer days.  </div></div></div> </div>,,17:04:2014,
