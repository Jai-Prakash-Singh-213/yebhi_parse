It boasts two close-cut steel foils that are ultra-hard-wearing for high-quality cutting. And because there are two foils  it means you get smoother results in double quick time. These dual foils also use independent flexing technology that ensures permanent contact whilst it glides seamlessly over your skin. This simple but intelligent piece of kit is stacked with so many functions that its low-cost price point makes it brilliant value for money. For those areas that require a bit more care  the F3800 features an intuitive pop-up trimmer for finer detailing--making styling and tidying tricky side burns a synch. Simply pull back the button on the top side of the shaver to release the trimmer and get grooming. Incredibly easy to use  the F3800 has an ergonomic design that fits comfortably into the palm of your hand  making light work of dry shaving. It s so simple to achieve a professional standard shave--just switch the shaver on by pushing up the button  hold the shaving head at a right angle so that both foils touch your skin simultaneously and gently apply a light pressure. Then move around your chin  neck and lower face using short  circular strokes. Easy! To charge  just plug the shaver into the adaptor and the indicator light will come on to show it s charging. When fully loaded  you ll have 40 minutes usage time. After you ve finished shaving  press the head release button to remove the head and rinse the foils under a tap to clean. Use the cleaning brush included to get rid of any stubble left in the cutters. For the best shaving performance  use your new shaver daily for up to four weeks to allow your beard and your skin to get used to the new shaving system. For the closest shave  make sure your skin is clean (free from products such as moisturisers) and dry; make sure both foils are touching the skin and are under equal pressure; and use short  circular movements to tackle more stubborn areas  like the chin  for a smoother result.
